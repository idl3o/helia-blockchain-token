# Project: Helia Blockchain Token

This project is focused on implementing a blockchain token system using Helia (IPFS implementation) for distributed storage.

## Key Components

- **Token Implementation**: Smart contract-like functionality for creating, transferring, and managing tokens
- **Helia Integration**: Using Helia for distributed storage of token data
- **P2P Network**: Utilizing libp2p for peer-to-peer communication
- **Cryptography**: Secure token management using cryptographic techniques

## Best Practices

- Follow blockchain token standards where applicable
- Implement proper error handling for network and blockchain operations
- Use appropriate security measures for key management
- Optimize for performance and scalability
